An Android device will be necessary to run this React Native app. For simplicity and onboarding purposes, an Android Virtual Device allowed emulating an Android device. Android Studio is a good tool for this process using a virtual "Pie API Level 28" device.  

## Steps to run and debug 

Open this project on Android Studio and access the list of available Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) by opening "AVD Manager". 

Once chosen the device desired, click on the green triangle button next to your AVD to launch it.

Now, from terminal, run

```
react-native run-android
```

and you're done! And if you want to check tests just run

```
yarn test
```
